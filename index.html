            <h2>Step-by-Step Installation</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Identify the Signal Wire</h3>
                <p>Locate the ignition coil pack in your engine bay. Identify the signal wire on each coil pack, which is typically the **Green/Light-Green** wire (rightmost wire on the connector).</p>

            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 2: Cut the Signal Wire</h3>
                <p>Ensure the engine is off and the battery is disconnected. Carefully cut the signal wire (Green/Light-Green) on each ignition coil, leaving enough length on both ends to connect to the relay.</p>
                <img src="images/cut-wire2.jpg" alt="Cutting the Signal Wire"> 
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Safety Tip:</strong> Always disconnect the battery before cutting any wires to prevent electrical shock or short circuits.

            <div class="step interactive-diagram">
                <h3>Step 3: Wiring the 5-Pin Relay</h3>
                <p>Wire the relay as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pin 85 (Ground):</strong> Connect to a solid ground point.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pin 86 (Trigger):</strong> Connect to the push button's trigger wire.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pin 30 (From ECU):</strong> Connect to the **Yellow/Brown** wire from the ignition coil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pin 87a (To Coils):</strong> Connect to the **Green/Light-Green** signal wire from the coil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pin 87:</strong> Not used in this setup.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Installing the Push Button Inside the Car</h3>
                <p>Choose a convenient location inside your car to mount the push button. Wire the button as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Terminal 1:</strong> Connect to a 12V ignition power source (use a fuse tap if necessary).</li>
                    <li><strong>Terminal 2:</strong> Connect to Pin 86 on the relay.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 5: Testing the System</h3>
                <p>Reconnect the battery and start your car. Press the push button to activate the ignition cut-off system. The engine should either stall or limit RPMs based on your setup. Release the button to resume normal operation.</p>
